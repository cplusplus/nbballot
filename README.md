# nbballot
Use issues to track NB comments in response to ballots.

Rules:

* Most meeting discussion goes on the wiki, not the GitHub issue.
* GitHub issue comments: When a group has discussed a paper or NB
comment, that group’s chair adds a comment to the corresponding GitHub issue
reading something like: “LEWG in Belfast: Needs more discussion.” or “EWG in Belfast:
Approved X.” or “SG99 in Belfast: Recommend to reject.” Adding a link
to the wiki page is appreciated. As per ISO guidance, do not quote discussion
details. Quoting numeric poll results is far less important than clearly stating
the net outcome.
* Study Groups "recommend" dispositions and forward to LEWG/EWG.
LEWG, EWG, LWG, and CWG as well as the editors can "reject",
in which case the issue should be closed.
LWG, CWG, and the editors "accept" or "reject".
* GitHub issue labels: When your group is done with an issue, de-assign your
group’s label and, if it was not rejected, assign the label(s)
of the next group(s) to look at the paper. (SGs never reject, they always
progress.) If a paper needs revision and then needs to come back to your group,
leave your group's label. In short, every open issue should have at least one
group label.
* GitHub issue closing: If an issue was rejected for good, close the issue. Do
not change any labels, so that we can discover which group rejected the
proposal.
