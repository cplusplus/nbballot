# nbballot
Use issues to track NB comments in response to ballots.

Rules:

* Most meeting discussion goes on the wiki, not the GitHub issue.
* GitHub issue comments: When a group has discussed a paper or NB
comment, that group’s chair adds a comment to the corresponding GitHub issue
reading something like: “LEWG in Belfast: Needs revision.” or “EWG in Belfast:
Approved for C++20.” or “SG99 in Belfast: Recommend to reject.” Adding a link
to the wiki page is appreciated. As per ISO guidance, do not quote discussion
details.
* GitHub issue labels: When your group is done with an issue, de-assign your
group’s label and, if it was not rejected for further progress, assign the label(s)
of the next group(s) to look at the paper. (SGs never reject, they always
progress.) If a paper needs revision and then needs to come back to your group,
leave your group's label. In short, every open issue should have at least one
group label.
* GitHub issue milestones: When your group is done with an issue, feel free
to delete the milestone so that "label:group milestone:2019-11" actually shows
the issues remaining on the group's plate for that meeting. When your group
asks for revisions, assigning the "needs-revision" label is also fine.
* GitHub issue closing: If an issue was rejected for good, close the issue. Do
not change any labels, so that we can discover which group rejected the
proposal.
